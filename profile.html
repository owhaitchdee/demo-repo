			I am passionate about being in the business of transformation. For the past 20 years, I have been with a team who help clients significantly improve the way they operate and manage their businesses through the use of innovative products and latest technologies. This has given me an opportunity to develop my business and technology expertise by being involved in various areas: business analysis, project management, product designing and development, quality management, marketing and business development. 
			<br><br>Much of the fulfillment still comes from knowing that the software solutions we provide our clients have transformed their businesses and helped them stay ahead of competition. 
			<br><br>My goal is to bring the transformation we do to greater levels by creating web-enabled businesses and changing industries in a way that challenges what others know as impossible.
			<br><br>It all starts with creating the right design for you.
